    <p>Diamond Dash is a 24-hour Minecraft event where players race to collect as many diamonds as possible before the
        server closes. Kill your competitors along the way to win bonus rewards like DoorDash gift cards. At the
        end of the event, the top three players will earn $3 for every diamond in their inventory, so every block
        counts! </p>
